      <translation>It was then that a certain monk came to the Buddha, [bowed his head at the Buddha’s feet, and withdrew to stand to one side. He said, “It’d be excellent, Bhagavān, if you would briefly explain the teaching for me now. After hearing the teaching, I’ll go alone to a quiet place and cultivate it earnestly. After cultivating it earnestly, I’ll again contemplate: ‘It’s because a good man leaves home, shaves his hair, puts on the Dharma robes, becomes faithful, goes homeless, and leaves home to train in the ultimate and unsurpassed religious life that he realizes in the present life: “My births have been ended, the religious practice has been established, and the task has been accomplished. I myself know that I won’t be subject to a later existence.”’”]</translation>
